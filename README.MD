# Password Generator
## About
This is a Password Generator which uses Javascript to create a secure password for any account needs.
## How To Use
1. Enter the length of your desired password into either the Length textbox or by using the accessible slider bar.
2. Choose your paramaters by checking the labelled boxes (box labels are self explanatory).
3. Hit that big 'ol Generate Password button once you're happy with the fields you have inputted in.
4. ~~Profit~~ Watch the Javascript do it's magic while it returns your brand new secure password in the top password display box.
5. Use the generated password as a password for your deepest desires (or just whatever new service you're signing up to).
## Aknowledgements
__Web Dev Simplified__ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw I followed his password generator tutorial, and as such the JS is heavily inspired by his code.
