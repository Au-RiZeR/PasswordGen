# Password Generator
## About
This is a Password Generator which uses Javascript to create a secure password for any account needs.
## How To Use
1. Press the Generate Password button (it's the red one, it's also the only button).
2. A prompt will appear asking for your desired password length, please enter a numeral between 8 and 128
3. After the length prompt you'll recieve a series of prompts asking for your paramaters, use the cancel button if you do not want the asked parameter
4. ~~Profit~~ Watch the Javascript do it's magic while it returns your brand new secure password in the top password display box.
5. Use the generated password as a password for your deepest desires (or just whatever new service you're signing up to).
